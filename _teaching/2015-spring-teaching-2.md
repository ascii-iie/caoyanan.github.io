Introduction
======
Question answering (QA) is a computer science discipline within the fields of information retrieval and natural language processing (NLP), which is concerned with building systems that automatically answer questions posed by humans in a natural language.

Classification
======
QA is not a single atom task but a assembling application which is composed by a group of technical components and has various forms. Moreover, different forms have very different technical roadmaps. 

Looking forward
======
* Knowledge + NN (as human beings)
* Transferring leaning QA
* Commonsense based QA
* Unsupervised QA
